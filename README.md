# Graal Cloud Native (GCN)

Graal Cloud Native (GCN) is a curated set of open source MicronautÂ® framework modules designed from the ground up to be compiled ahead-of-time with GraalVM Native Image resulting in native executables ideal for microservices.
With GCN, you can build portable cloud-native Java microservices that start instantly and use fewer resources to reduce compute costs.
